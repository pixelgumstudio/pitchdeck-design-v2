            I was always lost looking for high-quality pitch decks from top
            founders who have successfully raised capital. It was scattered all
            over the internet, so I decided to compile them into a single
            directory.
          </h2>
          <h3 className="text-16 tablet:text-20 mb-3">
            My name is Olayanju Idris. I am a senior product designer who runs a
            small design studio called Pixelgum Studio. I created this platform
            to help pitch deck and presentation designers who don&apos;t want to
            search for resources all over the internet. This is a directory of
            over 500 carefully curated pitch decks, divided into different
            categories depending on the type of pitch deck you are looking to
            design or draw inspiration from. We have done all the hard work for
            you, and we hope you like it.
